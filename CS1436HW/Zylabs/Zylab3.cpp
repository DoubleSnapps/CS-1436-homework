Sample output from a program that passes all tests for one possible set of inputs:

This program converts a time entered in seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.
Please enter a time in seconds: 3775

3775 seconds is:
        1 hours
        2 minutes
        55 seconds

Please notice that there is one tab character before the labels on the output hours, minutes, and seconds.

Use the same prompts and messages as the sample above. Please make careful note of the casing and white space shown.

Failure to follow the requirements for lab lessons can result in deductions, even if you pass the auto-graded tests.
